            Domestic cats (Felis catus) are small, carnivorous mammals in the Felidae family, domesticated for over 4,000 to 9,500 years. As highly evolved predators, they possess flexible bodies, sharp retractable claws, acute senses, and nocturnal vision. They are, on average, independent yet affectionate, and they communicate via vocalizations, pheromones, and body language.
